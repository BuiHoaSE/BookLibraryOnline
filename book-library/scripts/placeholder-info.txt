BOOK COVER PNG INSTRUCTIONS

To add the book cover PNG files to your application:

1. Save the book cover images you showed in your messages as PNG files
2. Rename them according to this naming convention:
   - to-kill-a-mockingbird.png
   - 1984.png
   - the-great-gatsby.png
   - pride-and-prejudice.png
   - the-catcher-in-the-rye.png

3. Place these PNG files in:
   D:\BookLibraryProject\book-library\public\images\covers\

4. If you don't have the original images, search for the book covers online and 
   save images that match the dimensions of approximately 200px width by 300px height.

The application is now configured to display these PNG images directly. 
The error handling in the application will automatically use placeholder text
if any image can't be found.

The SVG files created earlier can also serve as placeholders until you add 
the actual PNG images.
